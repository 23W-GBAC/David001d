Task And Solutions 
-------
Week 1 
-----
When I began my research on Artificial Intelligence and it's application in the antimicrobial I had cardinal questions which became a task, I also delved deep to provide a solution. Check it out below.

Task
-------
- [x] how to identify potential antimicronbial compounds using AI, not using the traditional way which is time consuming 
--------

Solution 
----------

-  by using datasets of molecular-like structures statistical task using sum of squared errors.

step 1 -  Loading Datasets :

import pandas as pd

Load the dataset
url = 'https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/0024/data_features.csv'
dataset = pd.read_csv(url, header=0)

step 2 - Feature Selection

For our solution , we'll only use the features x1, x2, x3, and x4.

#Select the features

#features = ['x1', 'x2', 'x3', 'x4']

# generate_blog_post.py
```
import nbformat

from nbconvert import MarkdownExporter
from jinja2 import Environment, FileSystemLoader
import datetime
```
# Load Jupyter Notebook
notebook_path = "Transformative_AI_Antimicrobial_Research.ipynb"
with open(notebook_path, "r", encoding="utf-8") as f:
    notebook_content = nbformat.read(f, as_version=4)

# Convert Notebook to Markdown
```
md_exporter = MarkdownExporter()
md_content, _ = md_exporter.from_notebook_node(notebook_content)
```
# Load Markdown Template
```
template_loader = FileSystemLoader(searchpath="./")
template_env = Environment(loader=template_loader)
template = template_env.get_template("blog_template.md")
```
# Create Output Markdown File
```
output_path = f"output_blog_{datetime.datetime.now().strftime('%Y%m%d%H%M%S')}.md"
with open(output_path, "w", encoding="utf-8") as output_file:
    output_file.write(template.render(notebook_content=md_content))

print(f"Blog post generated successfully: {output_path}")
```

#dataset = dataset[features]

step 3 - Data Preprocessing
#Convert categorical data to numerical data
from sklearn.preprocessing import LabelEncoder


#for feature in features:
    labelencoder = LabelEncoder()
    dataset[feature] = labelencoder.fit_transform(dataset[feature])


#Scale our features
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler


#scaler = StandardScaler()
dataset = pd.DataFrame(scaler.fit_transform(dataset), columns=features)

step 4 -  Statistical Task

#Load the target variable
```
url = 'https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/0024/data_target.csv'
target = pd.read_csv(url, header=0)
```

#Compute the SSE
```
sse = sum((dataset['x1'] - target['y']) ** 2)
print('SSE:', sse)
```

# Define the topic
topic = "Transformative Role of Artificial Intelligence in Antimicrobial Research and Management"

# Define key problems related to the topic
problems = [
    "Limited drug discovery capabilities for combating antimicrobial resistance",
    "Inaccurate prediction of antimicrobial resistance patterns",
    "Challenges in personalizing antimicrobial treatment plans",
    "Slow and inefficient diagnostic testing methods",
    "Ineffective surveillance systems for monitoring antimicrobial usage",
    "Regulatory hurdles and ethical concerns surrounding AI adoption"
]

# Define corresponding solutions to the problems
solutions = [
    "Utilizing AI algorithms to analyze large datasets and identify potential drug candidates",
    "Developing machine learning models to predict antimicrobial resistance with higher accuracy",
    "Implementing precision medicine approaches based on AI-driven patient data analysis",
    "Creating AI-powered diagnostic tools for rapid and accurate detection of infections",
    "Deploying AI surveillance systems to monitor antimicrobial usage trends in real-time",
    "Addressing regulatory challenges through collaboration with regulatory agencies and stakeholders"
]

# Generate the blog post content

    intro = f"Today, we explore the {topic} and discuss some common problems encountered in antimicrobial research and management."
    main_content = "\n\n".join([f"- Problem: {p}\n  Solution: {s}" for p, s in zip(problems, solutions)])
    conclusion = "By leveraging the power of artificial intelligence, we can overcome these challenges and pave the way for more effective antimicrobial research and management."

    blog_post = f"{intro}\n\n{main_content}\n\n{conclusion}"
    return blog_post

# Write the blog post to a file
def write_blog_post(filename, content):
    with open(filename, "w") as f:
        f.write(content)

# Generate and save the blog post
blog_content = generate_blog_post()
filename = "blog_post.txt"
write_blog_post(filename, blog_content)


Task
-------
- [x] how to  put these in a interactive interface or a much better display 
--------

Solution 
----------

by using Java script
<!DOCTYPE html>

<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">

</head>
<body>
    <h1>Transformative Role of Artificial Intelligence in Antimicrobial Research and Management</h1>
    <div id="blog-content"></div>

    <script>
        // Fetch the generated blog post content from the Python script
        fetch('blog_post.txt')
            .then(response => response.text())
            .then(data => {
                // Display the blog post content on the webpage
                document.getElementById('blog-content').innerText = data;
